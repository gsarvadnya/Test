        Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
            51 Franklin Street, Suite 500, Boston, MA  02110-1335  USA
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

       [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
        as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
        the version number 2.1.]

       			    Preamble

         The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
       freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
       Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
       free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

         This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
       specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
       Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
       can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
       this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
       strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

         When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
       not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
       you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
       for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
       it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
       it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
       these things.

         To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
       distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
       rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
       you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

         For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
       or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
       you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
       code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
       complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
       with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
       it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

         We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
       library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
       permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

         To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
       there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
       modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
       that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
       author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
       introduced by others.
       
         Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
       any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
       effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
       restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
       any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
       consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

         Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
       ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
       General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
       is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
       this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
       libraries into non-free programs.

         When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
       a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
       combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
       General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
       entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
       Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
       the library.

         We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
       does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
       Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
       of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
       are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
       libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
       special circumstances.

         For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
       encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
       a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
       allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
       library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
       case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
       software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

         In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
       programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
       free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
       non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
       operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
       system.

         Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
       users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
       linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
       that program using a modified version of the Library.

         The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
       modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
       "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
       former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
       be combined with the library in order to run.
       
       		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
          TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

         0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
       program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
       other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
       this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
       Each licensee is addressed as "you".

         A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
       prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
       (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

         The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
       which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
       Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
       copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
       portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
       straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
       included without limitation in the term "modification".)

         "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
       making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
       all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
       interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
       and installation of the library.

         Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
       covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
       running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
       such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
       on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
       writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
       and what the program that uses the Library does.
         
         1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
       complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
       you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
       appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
       all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
       warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
       Library.

         You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
       and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
       fee.
       
         2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
       of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
       distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
       above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

           a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

           b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
           stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

           c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
           charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

           d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
           table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
           the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
           is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
           in the event an application does not supply such function or
           table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
           its purpose remains meaningful.

           (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
           a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
           application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
           application-supplied function or table used by this function must
           be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
           root function must still compute square roots.)

       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
       on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
       it.

       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
       collective works based on the Library.

       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
       with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
       the scope of this License.

         3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
       License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
       this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
       that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
       instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
       ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
       that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
       these notices.
       
         Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
       that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
       subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

         This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
       the Library into a program that is not a library.

         4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
       derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
       under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
       it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
       must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
       medium customarily used for software interchange.

         If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
       source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
       distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
       compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

         5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
       Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
       linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
       work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
       therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

         However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
       creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
       contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
       library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
       Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

         When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
       that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
       derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
       Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
       linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
       threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

         If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
       structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
       functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
       file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
       work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
       Library will still fall under Section 6.)

         Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
       distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
       Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
       whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
       
         6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
       link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
       work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
       under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
       modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
       engineering for debugging such modifications.

         You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
       Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
       this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
       during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
       copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
       directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
       of these things:

           a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
           machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
           changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
           Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
           with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
           uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
           user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
           executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
           that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
           Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
           to use the modified definitions.)

           b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
           Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
           copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
           rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
           will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
           the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
           interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

           c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
           least three years, to give the same user the materials
           specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
           than the cost of performing this distribution.

           d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
           from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
           specified materials from the same place.

           e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
           materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

         For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
       Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
       reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
       the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
       normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
       components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
       which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
       the executable.

         It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
       restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
       accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
       use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
       distribute.
       
         7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
       Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
       facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
       library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
       the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
       permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
           based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
           facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
           Sections above.

           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
           that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
           where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

         8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
       the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
       attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
       distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
       rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
       or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
       terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

         9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
       signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
       distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
       prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
       modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
       Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
       all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
       the Library or works based on it.

         10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
       Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
       original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
       subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
       restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
       You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
       this License.
       
         11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
       infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
       conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
       otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
       excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
       distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
       License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
       may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
       license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
       all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
       the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
       refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

       If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
       particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
       and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

       It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
       patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
       such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
       integrity of the free software distribution system which is
       implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
       generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
       through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
       system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
       to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
       impose that choice.

       This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
       be a consequence of the rest of this License.

         12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
       certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
       original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
       an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
       so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
       excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
       written in the body of this License.

         13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
       versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
       Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
       but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
       specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
       "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
       conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
       the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
       license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
       the Free Software Foundation.
       
         14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
       programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
       write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
       copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
       Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
       decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
       of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
       and reuse of software generally.

       			    NO WARRANTY

         15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
       WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
       EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
       OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
       IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
       LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
       THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

         16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
       WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
       AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
       FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
       CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
       LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
       RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
       FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
       SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
       DAMAGES.

       		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
       
                  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

         If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
       possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
       everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
       redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
       ordinary General Public License).

         To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
       safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
       convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
       "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

           <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
           Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

           This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
           modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
           License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
           version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

           This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
           but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
           MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
           Lesser General Public License for more details.

           You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
           License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
           Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Suite 500, Boston, MA  02110-1335  USA

       Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

       You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
       school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
       necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

         Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
         library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

         <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
         Ty Coon, President of Vice

       That's all there is to it!

       GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       		       Version 2.1, February 1999

        Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
            51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

       [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
        as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
        the version number 2.1.]

       			    Preamble

         The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
       freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
       Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
       free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

         This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
       specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
       Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
       can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
       this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
       strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

         When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
       not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
       you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
       for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
       it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
       it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
       these things.

         To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
       distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
       rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
       you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

         For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
       or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
       you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
       code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
       complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
       with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
       it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

         We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
       library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
       permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

         To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
       there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
       modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
       that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
       author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
       introduced by others.
       
         Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
       any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
       effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
       restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
       any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
       consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

         Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
       ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
       General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
       is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
       this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
       libraries into non-free programs.

         When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
       a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
       combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
       General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
       entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
       Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
       the library.

         We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
       does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
       Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
       of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
       are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
       libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
       special circumstances.

         For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
       encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
       a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
       allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
       library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
       case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
       software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

         In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
       programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
       free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
       non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
       operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
       system.

         Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
       users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
       linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
       that program using a modified version of the Library.

         The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
       modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
       "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
       former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
       be combined with the library in order to run.
       
       		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
          TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

         0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
       program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
       other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
       this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
       Each licensee is addressed as "you".

         A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
       prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
       (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

         The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
       which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
       Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
       copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
       portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
       straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
       included without limitation in the term "modification".)

         "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
       making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
       all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
       interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
       and installation of the library.

         Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
       covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
       running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
       such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
       on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
       writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
       and what the program that uses the Library does.
         
         1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
       complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
       you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
       appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
       all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
       warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
       Library.

         You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
       and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
       fee.
       
         2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
       of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
       distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
       above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

           a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

           b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
           stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

           c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
           charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

           d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
           table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
           the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
           is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
           in the event an application does not supply such function or
           table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
           its purpose remains meaningful.

           (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
           a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
           application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
           application-supplied function or table used by this function must
           be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
           root function must still compute square roots.)

       These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
       identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
       and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
       themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
       sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
       distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
       on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
       this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
       entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
       it.

       Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
       your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
       exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
       collective works based on the Library.

       In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
       with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
       a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
       the scope of this License.

         3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
       License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
       this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
       that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
       instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
       ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
       that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
       these notices.
       
         Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
       that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
       subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

         This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
       the Library into a program that is not a library.

         4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
       derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
       under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
       it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
       must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
       medium customarily used for software interchange.

         If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
       source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
       distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
       compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

         5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
       Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
       linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
       work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
       therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

         However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
       creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
       contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
       library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
       Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

         When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
       that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
       derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
       Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
       linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
       threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

         If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
       structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
       functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
       file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
       work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
       Library will still fall under Section 6.)

         Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
       distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
       Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
       whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
       
         6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
       link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
       work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
       under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
       modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
       engineering for debugging such modifications.

         You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
       Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
       this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
       during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
       copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
       directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
       of these things:

           a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
           machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
           changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
           Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
           with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
           uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
           user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
           executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
           that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
           Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
           to use the modified definitions.)

           b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
           Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
           copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
           rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
           will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
           the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
           interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

           c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
           least three years, to give the same user the materials
           specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
           than the cost of performing this distribution.

           d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
           from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
           specified materials from the same place.

           e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
           materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

         For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
       Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
       reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
       the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
       normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
       components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
       which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
       the executable.

         It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
       restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
       accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
       use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
       distribute.
       
         7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
       Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
       facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
       library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
       the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
       permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
           based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
           facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
           Sections above.

           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
           that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
           where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

         8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
       the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
       attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
       distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
       rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
       or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
       terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

         9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
       signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
       distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
       prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
       modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
       Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
       all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
       the Library or works based on it.

         10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
       Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
       original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
       subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
       restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
       You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
       this License.
       
         11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
       infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
       conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
       otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
       excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
       distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
       License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
       may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
       license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
       all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
       the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
       refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

       If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
       particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
       and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

       It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
       patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
       such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
       integrity of the free software distribution system which is
       implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
       generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
       through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
       system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
       to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
       impose that choice.

       This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
       be a consequence of the rest of this License.

         12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
       certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
       original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
       an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
       so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
       excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
       written in the body of this License.

         13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
       versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
       Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
       but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
       specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
       "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
       conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
       the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
       license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
       the Free Software Foundation.
       
         14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
       programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
       write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
       copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
       Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
       decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
       of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
       and reuse of software generally.

       			    NO WARRANTY

         15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
       WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
       EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
       OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
       IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
       LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
       THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

         16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
       WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
       AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
       FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
       CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
       LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
       RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
       FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
       SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
       DAMAGES.

       		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
       
                  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

         If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
       possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
       everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
       redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
       ordinary General Public License).

         To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
       safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
       convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
       "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

           <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
           Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

           This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
           modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
           License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
           version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

           This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
           but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
           MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
           Lesser General Public License for more details.

           You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
           License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
           Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

       Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

       You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
       school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
       necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

         Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
         library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

         <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
         Ty Coon, President of Vice

       That's all there is to it!

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

2. License Grants and Conditions



2.1. Grants



Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:



under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and



under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.



2.2. Effective Date



The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.



2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope



The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:



for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or



for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or



under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.



This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).



2.4. Subsequent Licenses



No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).



2.5. Representation



Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.



2.6. Fair Use



This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.



2.7. Conditions



Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.



3. Responsibilities



3.1. Distribution of Source Form



All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.



3.2. Distribution of Executable Form



If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:



such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and



You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.



3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work



You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).



3.4. Notices



You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.



3.5. Application of Additional Terms



You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.



4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation



If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.



5. Termination



5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.



5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.



5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.



6. Disclaimer of Warranty



Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.



7. Limitation of Liability



Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.



8. Litigation



Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.



9. Miscellaneous



This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.



10. Versions of the License



10.1. New Versions



Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.



10.2. Effect of New Versions



You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.



10.3. Modified Versions



If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).



10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses



If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.



Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice



This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.



If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.



You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.



Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice



This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

		   Version 1.1, March 2000

 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
      under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
      or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
      Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
      A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
      Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.


-------------------- SECTION 5: GNU General Public License, V2.0 --------------------

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.


-------------------- SECTION 6: Artistic License, V2.0 --------------------

Artistic License 2.0



Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.



You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.



Definitions



"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.



"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.



"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.



"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.



"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.



"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.



"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.



"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.



"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.



"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.



"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution



(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.



Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version



(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.



(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.



Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source



(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of 

the following:



(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version. 



(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version. 



(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under 



(i) the Original License or 

(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.



Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions 

without the Source



(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.



(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.



Aggregating or Linking the Package



(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.



(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.



Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version



(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.



General Provisions



(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.



(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.



(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.



(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. 



If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.



(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER 

AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 

WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 

PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT 

PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT 

HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 

INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE 

USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.







-------------------- SECTION 7: Perl Artistic License --------------------

                        The "Artistic License"



				Preamble



The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a

Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some

semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,

while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute

the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make

reasonable modifications.



Definitions:



	"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the

	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files

	created through textual modification.



	"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been

	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes

	of the Copyright Holder as specified below.



	"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or

	copyrights for the package.



	"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing

	this Package.



	"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the

	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,

	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the

	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large

	as a market that must bear the fee.)



	"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item

	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.

	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it

	under the same conditions they received it.



1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the

Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you

duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.



2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications

derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package

modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.



3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided

that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and

when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the

following:



    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them

    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or

    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive

    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include

    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.



    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.



    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict

    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide

    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly

    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.



    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.



4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or

executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:



    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,

    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where

    to get the Standard Version.



    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of

    the Package with your modifications.



    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly

    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together

    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.



    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.



5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this

Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this

Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,

you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly

commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software

distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a

product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within

an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere

form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the

interpreter is so embedded.



6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as

output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall

under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated

them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this

Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this

Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a

binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall

neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it

fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do

not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this

Package.



7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other

languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to

emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this

Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the

equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do

not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the

regression tests for the language.



8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always

permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,

when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible

to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be

construed as a distribution of this Package.



9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote

products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.



10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR

IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED

WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

-------------------- SECTION 8: GNU General Public License, V1.0 --------------------

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

		     Version 1, February 1989



 Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



			    Preamble



  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users

at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public

License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free

software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The

General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's

software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.

You can use it for your programs, too.



  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not

price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make

sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free

software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,

that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free

programs; and that you know you can do these things.



  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid

anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you

distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.



  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether

gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that

you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the

source code.  And you must tell them their rights.



  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and

(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,

distribute and/or modify the software.



  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain

that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free

software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we

want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so

that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original

authors' reputations.



  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

modification follow.



		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION



  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which

contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be

distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The

"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based

on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the

Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each

licensee is addressed as "you".



  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source

code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and

disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this

General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any

other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License

along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of

transferring a copy.



  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of

it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph

1 above, provided that you also do the following:



    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that

    you changed the files and the date of any change; and



    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that

    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either

    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all

    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except

    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all

    third parties, at your option).



    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when

    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use

    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an

    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice

    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a

    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these

    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General

    Public License.



    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a

    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in

    exchange for a fee.



Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its

derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring

the other work under the scope of these terms.



  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of

it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of

Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:



    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable

    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of

    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,



    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three

    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge

    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the

    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of

    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,



    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the

    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is

    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you

    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)



Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means

all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special

exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard

libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable

file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that

accompany that operating system.



  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the

Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.

Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer

the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use

the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received

copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public

License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties

remain in full compliance.



  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based

on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,

and all its terms and conditions.



  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the

Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original

licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these

terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the

recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.



  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions

of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will

be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to

address new problems or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program

specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any

later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions

either of that version or of any later version published by the Free

Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of

the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software

Foundation.



  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free

programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author

to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free

Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes

make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals

of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and

of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



			    NO WARRANTY



  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY

FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN

OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES

PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED

OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS

TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE

PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,

REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING

WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR

REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,

INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING

OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED

TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY

YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER

PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS



	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest

possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it

free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these

terms.



  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to

attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey

the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the

"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.



    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>



    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify

    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)

    any later version.



    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

    GNU General Public License for more details.



    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

    Foundation, Inc.



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this

when it starts in an interactive mode:



    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author

    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the

appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the

commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show

c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your

program.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your

school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if

necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:



  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes

  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

-------------------- SECTION 9: GNU General Public License, V3.0 --------------------

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
